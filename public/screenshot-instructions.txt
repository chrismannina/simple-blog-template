# Blog Screenshot Instructions

For a more professional looking repository, add a screenshot of your blog to the README.

## How to add a screenshot

1. Take a screenshot of your blog's homepage when it's running
2. Save the screenshot as `blog-screenshot.png` in the `public` directory
3. The image will automatically be displayed in the README

## Recommended screenshot dimensions

- Width: 1200-1400px
- Height: 600-800px

This will ensure your screenshot looks good on GitHub without being too large.

Note: If you don't add a screenshot, the placeholder image will be shown instead.
