# How to Format Your Blog Posts

This template uses Markdown for formatting your blog posts, making it easy to create rich content without dealing with HTML.

## Basic Formatting

**Bold text** is created with `**double asterisks**`

*Italic text* uses `*single asterisks*`

## Code Blocks

```javascript
// Syntax highlighted code blocks
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, blog reader!");
}
```

## Lists

- Create lists with hyphens
- Add as many items as needed
  - Indent with two spaces for nested items

1. Numbered lists use numbers
2. They'll automatically stay in sequence

See the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for more formatting options.
