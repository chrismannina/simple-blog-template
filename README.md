## Adding Blog Posts

To add a new blog post, simply create a markdown file in the `src/posts` directory. The filename will be used as the URL slug.

### Frontmatter

Each blog post must include frontmatter at the very top of the file. Frontmatter is YAML metadata surrounded by triple-dash lines (`---`).

**Example:**

```markdown
---
title: My Awesome Blog Post
date: 2023-08-15
excerpt: This is a short summary of my blog post that will appear in the blog listing.
tags: ['react', 'javascript', 'tutorial']
coverImage: https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg
---

# My Awesome Blog Post

Your content goes here...
```

### Required Fields

- `title`: The title of your blog post
- `date`: The publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### Recommended Fields

- `excerpt`: A short summary shown in the post list
- `tags`: An array of tags
- `coverImage`: URL to your cover image

### Important Notes About Frontmatter

1. The frontmatter **must** be at the very top of the file with no blank lines before it
2. You can include an H1 title after the frontmatter that matches your frontmatter title - it will be automatically removed from the content since the title is displayed separately in the blog layout
3. All frontmatter fields are parsed using the `gray-matter` library

## Customizing Your Blog

You can customize your blog by editing the `src/config/blog.config.ts` file. This file contains configuration options such as:

- Blog title and description
- Author information
- Navigation links
- Date formatting
- And more!

## Dark Mode

This blog template includes a fully functional dark mode with the following features:

- Toggle button in the navigation bar
- System preference detection
- Persistent preference (saved to localStorage)
- Beautiful dark theme styling
- Smooth transitions between light and dark modes

You can configure dark mode options in the `blog.config.ts` file:

```typescript
design: {
  accentColor: "green", // Choose from: "indigo", "blue", "green", "amber"
  darkMode: {
    enabled: true,
    default: 'system', // Choose from: 'light', 'dark', 'system'
  },
},
```

## Building for Production

To build your blog for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting service.

## Deployment Options

Deploy your blog to your favorite hosting platform:

### Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Netlify

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy
```

### GitHub Pages

Add this to your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/your-repo-name/', // Replace with your repository name
  // other config...
})
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
